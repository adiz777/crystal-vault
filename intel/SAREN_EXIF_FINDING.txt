SAREN EXIF METADATA DISCOVERY
==============================
Date: 2025-12-30
Source: https://www.saren.gob.ve/

FINDING: SAREN (Servicio Autonomo de Registros y Notarias) does NOT strip
EXIF metadata from uploaded images, unlike SAIME which strips all metadata.

SAMPLE FILE ANALYZED:
  URL: https://www.saren.gob.ve/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Noticia-46-1.jpg
  Size: 427,388 bytes (417 KB)

EXTRACTED EXIF DATA:
  Camera Manufacturer: Canon
  Camera Model: Canon EOS 5D Mark III
  DateTime: 2025:12:24 20:40:57
  Resolution: 2048x1770
  X Resolution: 300 DPI
  Y Resolution: 300 DPI

IMPLICATIONS:
  - SAREN images may contain GPS coordinates if geotagging was enabled
  - Timestamps reveal when photos were actually taken (not just uploaded)
  - Camera model reveals equipment used by government photographers
  - Could potentially identify specific photographers by equipment patterns
  - Software used for editing may be revealed in metadata

COMPARISON:
  - SAIME: Strips all EXIF metadata (WordPress default behavior)
  - SAREN: Retains EXIF metadata (non-standard WordPress config)
  - VTV/AVN/Correo: Untested, may also retain EXIF

RECOMMENDATION:
  - Download and analyze all 100 SAREN media files for EXIF
  - Check for GPS coordinates in outdoor event photos
  - Cross-reference timestamps with published event dates
  - Build equipment profile of government photographers

NOTE: Browser cannot display images due to SAREN's "Clear-Site-Data: cache"
header, but images can be downloaded via curl and analyzed offline.

FILES IN EXFIL:
  C:\Users\Squir\Desktop\crystal-vault\exfil\SAREN\SAREN_Media_1.json
  (100 media URLs with metadata)
