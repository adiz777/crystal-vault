## Overview

Crystal Vault documents Venezuela's centralized surveillance database announced in December 2024. The system, built by Chinese company ZTE, merges citizen identity records, banking data, and social program participation for over 30 million Venezuelans.

The regime exposed their infrastructure through unsecured WordPress REST APIs. Approximately **27.7 GB** of data was retrieved without authentication, including government office locations, staff GPS coordinates, and operational statistics.
