**Documenting Venezuela's surveillance infrastructure through their own open APIs.**

## What Is Crystal Vault?

On December 24-26, 2025, Venezuela's SAIME (identity agency) announced migration to **"La Bóveda de Cristal"** (The Crystal Vault) — a centralized database merging citizen identity records, banking data, and social program participation for 30+ million Venezuelans.

Built by **ZTE Corporation (China)**, this system consolidates:
- SAIME (national ID / cedulas)
- BCV (central banking)
- Sistema Patria (social programs / surveillance)
- CNE (voter registration) — suspected

This repository documents what I found when I looked at their public infrastructure.

---

## The Irony

They built a surveillance system to track every citizen.

They announced it on a **WordPress blog with open REST APIs**.

I pulled their entire office network, operational statistics, and infrastructure documentation — **no authentication required**.

## Key Findings

### Operational Statistics (from their own posts)
- **7,257** cedulas issued to fishermen (tracking fishing communities)
- **15,511** indigenous IDs issued (tracking native populations)
- **56,785** workers ID'd at workplaces (employment surveillance)
- **127,415** processed at Plaza Caracas in 2025
- **21.8 million** Sistema Patria users (as of Jan 2023)

### Sanctioned Individuals with Cedulas
I extracted ~210 cedula numbers from OFAC sanctions data:

| Name | Cedula | Role |
|------|--------|------|
| Tareck El Aissami | 12.354.211 | Former VP, drug trafficking |
| Hugo Carvajal Barrios | 8.352.301 | Former intel chief |
| Gustavo González López | 5.726.284 | SEBIN director |
| Henry Rangel Silva | 5.764.952 | Defense minister |
| Freddy Bernal Rosales | 5.665.018 | Táchira governor |

## For Researchers

This data enables:
- **Mapping government capacity** — 134 office locations visualized
- **Sanctions enforcement** — Cedula cross-referencing
- **Infrastructure analysis** — Understanding regime digital systems
- **Humanitarian planning** — Office accessibility for displaced persons

## For Journalists

Key angles:
- Chinese tech (ZTE) building Venezuelan surveillance
- Christmas 2025 database merger announcement
- Open APIs exposing what should be secured
- 7+ million refugees whose data remains in the system

## For the 7+ Million Venezuelan Refugees

Your data is still in Crystal Vault. The regime can:
- Track family members who remain
- Monitor financial activity through BCV integration
- Cross-reference voting patterns with benefits

This documentation exists so you know what they have.

## Legal & Ethical Notes

**All data collected from:**
- Publicly accessible REST APIs (no authentication bypassed)
- US Government public records (OFAC Treasury)
- Standard open-source intelligence methods

**No private systems were accessed.** This is what anyone with a browser and `curl` can retrieve. That's the point — the regime that surveils everyone forgot to secure anything.
