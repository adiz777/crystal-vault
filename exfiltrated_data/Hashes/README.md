# HASHES FOLDER - IMPORTANT NOTICE

## Why Media Organizations Were Removed

This folder previously contained WordPress user data from 140+ Venezuelan websites including numerous independent news outlets. **All journalist and media organization data has been permanently removed from this repository.**

### The Risk to Journalists

Even seemingly harmless data like usernames, display names, or Gravatar hashes poses real danger to journalists in Venezuela:

- **A name on a list is "proof"** - The Maduro regime has used any association with independent media as grounds for detention, harassment, or worse. Even a single op-ed published years ago can mark someone as a target.

- **WordPress users aren't always staff** - Many entries were guest contributors, one-time op-ed authors, or freelancers. Being listed alongside regular staff creates false equivalence and expands the target pool.

- **Email hashes can be reversed** - Gravatar MD5/SHA hashes can be cracked to reveal email addresses, expanding the attack surface for already-targeted journalists.

- **Independent outlets protect their people for a reason** - Many Venezuelan news organizations deliberately don't publish bylines or author names. Compiling this data undermines those protective measures.

### Context

Venezuelan independent journalists face:
- Arbitrary detention and imprisonment
- Equipment seizure and office raids
- Travel bans and passport confiscation
- Physical attacks and threats to family members
- Forced exile

Organizations like El Pitazo, Efecto Cocuyo, Runrunes, and others already operate under extreme pressure. Their journalists don't need their attack surface expanded by public data compilations.

## What Remains

The `ALL_HASHES_NO_MEDIA.txt` file contains only:
- Government entities (PATRIA, SAREN, Gobernacion Lara)
- State-controlled bank (Banco de Venezuela)
- Political parties (Voluntad Popular, COPEI)
- Civil society organizations that publicly list their staff
- Universities

**51 total entries** - down from 1,500+

## Proceed With Caution

Even with this reduced dataset:
- Consider whether publishing serves accountability or just creates risk
- Government employees at low levels may not be complicit in regime actions
- Civil society organizations listed here (CEDICE, PROVEA, COFAVIC) are human rights defenders, not regime actors

**Think twice before using any of this data in ways that could identify individuals.**
